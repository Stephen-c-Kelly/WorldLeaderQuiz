# World Leader Quiz

## Project Description 

(USE USERS instead of You'll of they ) 

"World Leaders" is an online quiz game build to help you memorize the names of world leaders and where they INSERT WORD FOR LEAD OR DO BUSINESS.  You will be able to pick a global region like Asia or Europe.  During gameplay, users will see a series of 20 cards (presented individually) representing countries in that region. Below the country title and the official flag, users will see a multiple choice question with 4 options: the name of the correct world leader and 3 other leaders in the region. After you make a selection, you'll see if your choice was correct or incorrect (if incorrect, you'll also see the correct option).  Users win if they are above 70% correct for the region.

The game is not timed; you can take as long as you want to choose your answers.  This game is built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I'd like to leverage an API or a Google Sheet to more easily update the names of the leaders after elections or world events, and include vector outlines of each country.  I'd also like to integrate a 'hard' option with a countdown clock.

#### Stretch Goals
