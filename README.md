# World Leader Quiz

## Project Description 

World Leaders is an online quiz game built to help you learn the names of more world leaders.  You will be able to pick a global region, like Asia or Europe, and see a set of 20 of cards representing countries in that region.  Upon clicking a card, users will see the name of the country, the official flag, and a series of multiple choice questions containing the name of the correct world leaders and 3 other leaders in the region. After you make a selection, you'll see if your choice was correct or incorrect (if in correct you'll also see the correct option).

The game is not timed, you can take as long as you want to answer all the cards in the region.  This game is built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I'd like to leverage an API or a Google Sheet to more easily update the names of the leaders after elections and include vector outlines of each country.  I'd also like to integrate a 'hard' option with a  countdown clock.

## Wire Frames

**Initial Home View**

View of homescreen where users can read instructions, select a region, and press play.

**Gameplay - Card Detail View**

- (optional) counter with number of cards remaining
- namme of country
- 4 choices
-- 1 correct option
-- 3 incorrect options (names taken from the list of leader's names in the region)
- Next button (inactive on page load)
- Play Again button (hidden until all cards have been played)

Upon making a selection, users will see the correct and incorrect options in green and red. Users will be able to click the next button to see another card in the stack

After all cards have been played, the card design is updated to show the number of correct guesses and a play again button.

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to be able to select a region of the world to start the game.
- As a player, I want to see a card with the name of a country and 4 options for the name of the world leader.
- As a player, I want to be able to reset the game if I selected the wrong region.
- As a player, I want to be able to make a selection and see if my choice was correcct.
- As a player, I want to see the correcct choice even if my choice was incorrect.
- As a player, I want to see how well I did at the end of the game.
- As a player, I want to reset the game and select another region to play again.
- As a player, I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals

- I'd like to implement animation to smooth the transition between cards.  
- I'd like to implement animation to make the correct/incorrect options more interesting/delightful.
- I'd like to leverage an API or a Google Sheet to more easily update the names of the leaders after elections
- I'd like to include vector outlines of each country.
- I'd like to integrate a 'countdown' option with a  countdown clock.
- I'd like to integrate a 'hard' option to make the 3 incorrect choices more difficult (maybe they can be the names of the countrie's former leader, or they can be other notable figures from that country).
- I'd like to include links to youtube videos showing how to pronounce each leader's name.
