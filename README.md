# World Leader Quiz

## Project Description 

(USE USERS instead of You'll of they ) 

"World Leaders" is an online quiz game built to help you memorize the names of world leaders and where they INSERT WORD FOR LEAD OR DO BUSINESS. You will be able to pick a global region like Asia or Europe.  During gameplay, you'll see a series of 20 cards (presented individually) representing countries in that region. Below the country title and the official flag, you will see a multiple-choice question with 4 options: the name of the correct world leader and 3 other leaders in the region. After you make a selection, you'll see if your choice was correct or incorrect (if incorrect, you'll also see the correct option).  Users win if they are above 60% correct for the region.

The game is not timed; you can take as long as you want to choose your answers.  This game is built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Developer notes:
I'd like to leverage an API or a Google Sheet to more easily update the names of the leaders after elections or world events, and include vector outlines of each country. Additional stretch goals are below.

#### MVP Goals

As a player...
- I want to be able to select a region of the world to start the game.
- I want to see a card with the name of a country and 4 options for the name of the world leader.
- I want to be able to reset the game if I select the wrong region.
- I want to be able to make a selection and see if my choice was correct.
- I want to see the correct choice even if my choice was incorrect.
- I want to see how well I did at the end of the game.
- I want to reset the game and select another region to play again.
- I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals

- *Gameplay Card Detail View* - add a counter with the number of cards completed/remaining.
- I'd like to implement animation to smooth the transition between cards.  
- I'd like to implement animation to make the correct/incorrect options more interesting/delightful.
- I'd like to leverage an API or a Google Sheet to more easily update the names of the leaders after elections.
- I'd like to include vector outlines of each country.
- I'd like to integrate a 'countdown' option with a  countdown clock.
- I'd like to integrate a 'hard' option to make the 3 incorrect choices more difficult (maybe they can be the names of the country's former leader, or they can be other notable figures from that country).
- I'd like to include links to YouTube videos showing how to pronounce each leader's name.
